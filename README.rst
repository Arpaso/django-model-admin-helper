Django Admin Helpers
====================

Provides classes to extend default django admin functionality:

1. **ButtonableModelAdmin** ;
2. **ModelAdminWithForeignKeyLinksMetaclass** - adds clickable foreign key links at admin interface in list view;
Uses **list_display** fields to try adding link to the field in list item.
3. **AdminURLMixin** - provides ability to extend /admin/ urls and make views to urls like: /admin/myurl ;


Usage
=====

**admin.py**::

    from admin_helpers import ButtonableModelAdmin, AdminURLMixin, ModelAdminWithForeignKeyLinksMetaclass

    class MyModelAdmin(AdminURLMixin, admin.ModelAdmin):
        __metaclass__ = ModelAdminWithForeignKeyLinksMetaclass

        def get_urls(self):
            urls = super(MyModelAdmin, self).get_urls()
            my_urls = patterns('',
                (r'^my_view/$', self.my_view)
            )
            return my_urls + urls

        def my_view(self, request):
            # custom view which should return an HttpResponse
            pass

**Note**:
Notice that the custom patterns are included before the regular admin URLs: the admin URL patterns are very permissive and will match nearly anything, so youâ€™ll usually want to prepend your custom URLs to the built-in ones.
In this example, my_view will be accessed at /admin/myapp/mymodel/my_view/ (assuming the admin URLs are included at /admin/.)
